# Deep learning-based eye tracking with high level purkinje images

In this work, we propose a method to estimate both gaze rotation and accommodation.

**eye_simulation**: Simulate a general eye model, user-specific face model, and also a ring model as supprt of camera and leds in Blender. Optimize camera and led positions for real experiments.

**eyetracker**: Track gaze based on purkinje images using deep learning.
